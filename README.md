# Ignite-Shoes-App

Ignite-Shoes-App is a shoe store mobile app, organized by brands such as Nike, Adidas, Mizuno, and others. It was developed using the Expo bare workflow, React Native, and TypeScript. The base code was provided by Rocketseat Education, and the push notifications and deep linking functionality were implemented by me.

4. On myconfig.js file insert your API Key on const OneSignalKey
5. Build the app `expo build:android` if android or `expo build:ios`. 
6. Once the build process is complete, you will receive a link to download the APK file or iOS build. Download and install the app on your device.
7. Start the development server by running the following command: `expo start`
8. Open the Expo Go app on your mobile device and scan the QR code displayed in the Expo developer tools in your web browser. This will launch the app on your device using a development build.
